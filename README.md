###### My Catalog of Languages

This is my big collection of Programming Languages, spanning from childhood up 'till now.
Because of this, most of 'em are unfinished and I likely won't be working on them any time soon.

This repo contains a bunch of folders for each language - and there'll be a table down there to point you to them as I upload them.
I've sorted the table by how early the language came in my life, starting at Renn and ending in whichever one comes last.
